Yo!
The name's Cherry, I'm a bit new to the whole coding stuff, so bear with me for a second here.

_What are my interests?_
I'm very passionate about coding and want mainly to create videogames, I'm a bit new to this, and school takes away a lot of time, so don't expect much to happen around
here, especially not often or on a specific schedule.
Things will get uploaded here whenever I'm happy enough with them.
